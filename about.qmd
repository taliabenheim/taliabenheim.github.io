## About Me

I am a PhD student in Health Services Research with a concentration in Health Economics at Brown University School of Public Health. My research aims to improve care quality and continuity for individuals with complex health needs. I have particular interests in nursing home staffing dynamics, post-acute care transitions, and the integration of mental/behavioral health services across various care settings. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a clinical research coordinator in the Department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics and Psychology from Wellesley College in 2021.
